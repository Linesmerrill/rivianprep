## Configuration complete

Congratulations! You've configured your Rivian. Now comes the hardest part: waiting.

You'll receive an email from Rivian saying something to the effect of "We'll be in touch!" Do not get financing quotes at this time. Quotes expire after 30 days, at which time you will need to rerun the credit check, which may lower your score.

Depending on your financing choice during configuration, you'll see an "Edit Design" button on your account page all the way up until your vehicle starts being built (this can be in as little as 7 days before taking delivery).

## First contact

You will eventually be contacted by a Rivian Guide who will confirm your delivery date. Make sure your Rivian account reflects this date.

You'll want to get your home charging solution worked out at this point. There are many options depending on your needs:

| Level   | Voltage | Rate of Charge                                                                                       |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1 | 120V    | 2-5 miles per hour of charging (regular outlet)                                                      |
| Level 2 | 240V    | 9-25 miles per hour of charging ([Rivian Wall Charger](https://rivian.com/gear-shop/p/wall-charger)) |
| Level 3 | 480V    | 200-1000 miles per hour of charging (DC Fast Charger)                                                |

Level 3 isn't really a home charging option; it's just here for comparison. If you drive fewer than 70 miles per day, a regular wall outlet should be just fine. If you're driving more than that, and a Rivian Wall Charger will give you peace of mind. Many states offer a [tax rebate](https://www.chargepoint.com/blog/electric-car-home-charger-rebates/) for the parts and labor of most charging solution installs.

Rivian has [a list of recommended installers](https://qmerit.com/ev/rivian/). Rivian partners with reputable local contractors to install the Wall Charger product in your home, but these contractors typically charge higher than average rates. Any experienced electrician should be able to do the work at a much lower price; it's a relatively simple job. You can also check [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o0sKqbg-a8&ab_channel=DoingitRuss) to do a DIY installation.

## 30 days before your delivery date

Now is the time to get financing quotes from credit unions, banks, etc. Whatever quotes you get, if your credit history is excellent, use [Lightstream](https://www.lightstream.com/) to get an unsecured cash loan. They will beat any approved rate you send them.

Ensure you have the routing/account number of the account(s) you will be transferring funds from on delivery day (especially important on weekends when banks are closed).

You may also want to order your [accessories](https://rivian.com/gear-shop/c/adventure-gear) now, as they are often sold out. Yes, it'll feel weird to have all weather floor mats with no vehicle, but it'll be worth it in the end. Not sure what to get? See the "Must-Have Accessories" section in the appendix.

## 10 days before your delivery date

Your "Edit Design" button and/or back-door link should stop working and you should finalize your financeer at this time. If the link still works, your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

## 7 days before your delivery date

Check your Rivian account for an assigned Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement (MVPA). If they are not showing up, the back-door method is to try buying a [Rivian Wall Charger](https://rivian.com/gear-shop/p/wall-charger). When you're checking out, if it says "No VIN assigned," you truly do not have a VIN. Your delivery date is probably going to be delayed.

If you have a VIN assigned, call your insurance to schedule the coverage date for your delivery day.

## Anytime before delivery

1.  Watch [R1T](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYrunRy8hmw&ab_channel=DougDeMuro) or [R1S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJbZjJNq9NM&ab_channel=DougDeMuro) walkthrough videos. These are great at getting you started with the basics and will speed up your handover process.
1.  Review the information supplied on the [Rivian Support pages](https://www.rivian.com/support), these pages go over details on financing, trade-ins, vehicle registration, insurance, warranty, etc.
1.  Attend a [Rivian owner orientation event](https://www.rivian.com/events). You will meet other owners and learn lots of handy tips about general ownership, driving and living with the car.
1.  Download [R1T](https://rivian.com/support/article/r1t-owners-guide) or [R1S](https://rivian.com/support/article/r1s-owners-guide) owners manuals. It will come in handy on your phone/computer for when you need it.

## Delivery day

### Before heading to the Delivery Center:

If you haven't had any contact with a Delivery Advisor/Scheduler since "First Contact," before you drive to pick your vehicle up, call the Rivian delivery location's direct number, and verify that your vehicle is indeed ready to go. There have been reports of people driving hours to pick up their Rivian only to be told their vehicle isn't even in production yet!

1.  Have the Rivian app installed on your smartphone prior to arrival for delivery.
2.  Bring your driverâ€™s license.
3.  If your vehicle will be registered to more than one person, each person on the registration needs to be at the delivery appointment to sign final documents.
4.  Bring written or digital proof of your down payment having been made and the final payment details or financing details. If you are financing, make sure your loan has been funded before you arrive to take delivery and that you have some kind of proof you can provide to Rivian should they ask about it.
5.  Bring a printed insurance card or other proof of insurance that shows your R1T|R1S is insured.
6.  Bring a dashcam, since at the time of writing this there is no built in dashcam offered.

### Arrival at the Delivery Center:

After checking in with a Rivian employee, you'll likely be waiting around for a while. It's rare for a Rivian delivery center to _not_ be busy. Expect to wait for 2 hours or more before you're taken to see your vehicle.

_NOTE: Do not sign final documents, or wire funds, until a full vehicle inspection is completed._

# VEHICLE INSPECTION CHECKLIST

- [R1S delivery checklist](r1s_checklist.md)

## Post-inspection:

### Verify post-delivery vehicle records

1.  Ask your delivery specialist to make sure that your vehicle is marked as DELIVERED in Rivian's network. _NOTE: Some owners have reported vehicles being delivered, but the phone key is disabled the following day. This is due to the vehicle not being marked as "Delivered" in the network._

2.  Make sure you have copies of all paperwork necessary for good documentation of your purchase, including a copy of your signed purchase agreement (MVPA). If your delivery specialist suggests that you can get your documents electronically on your Rivian account, ask for paper copies you can take with you anyway. Having physical copies with you ensures you will get them.

_Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Rivian is has a reputation of rectifying these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a vehicle you're not happy taking away that day, you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed._

### Before driving away, ask a Rivian rep:

1.  How to charge/ work a public charger / open the charge flap.
2.  Make sure the correct closing technique for rear spare tire flap is demonstrated.
3.  Driver+ usage.
4.  How to find [public chargers](http://plugshare.com/) / other chargers.
5.  How to open / move between apps on the display.
6.  Pair your phone and connect / reconnect Bluetooth.
7.  Steering wheel buttons / how to change what each do.
8.  How to do a full reset of the main screen.
9.  How to adjust seating, save profiles, have mirrors drop / not drop when reversing.
10. Review all settings pages.
11. Use of the Android or iPhone apps.
12. Where to find [roadside assistance](https://rivian.com/support/roadside-assistance) info from the main screen.
13. Your local [service center](https://rivian.com/support/servicing-a-rivian-vehicle) support number.

## After your first drive

1.  **Keep driving!**
1.  Download [Plugshare](http://plugshare.com/) to find public charging stations.
1.  Consider having the paint protected with ceramic paint protection, which will help prevent scratches, stone chips, etc.
1.  Consider alloy wheel insurance or protection.
1.  Learn how to properly wash your vehicle.
1.  When your registration arrives, check that it's the correct model listed (Launch Edition/Adventure/etc.), as it could affect selling your vehicle in the future, insurance coverage, etc.
1.  Respond to the surveys that Rivian periodically sends. This the best way that you can directly impact improvements to the vehicle and company.
